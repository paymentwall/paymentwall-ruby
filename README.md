# Code Samples

## Digital Goods API

#### Initializing Paymentwall
<pre><code>require 'paymentwall' # alternatively, require_relative '/path/to/paymentwall-ruby/lib/paymentwall.rb'
Paymentwall::Base::setApiType(Paymentwall::Base::API_GOODS)
Paymentwall::Base::setAppKey('YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY') # available in your Paymentwall merchant area
Paymentwall::Base::setSecretKey('YOUR_SECRET_KEY') # available in your Paymentwall merchant area
</code></pre>

#### Widget Call
[Web API details](http://www.paymentwall.com/en/documentation/Digital-Goods-API/710#paymentwall_widget_call_flexible_widget_call)

The widget is a payment page hosted by Paymentwall that embeds the entire payment flow: selecting the payment method, completing the billing details, and providing customer support via the Help section. You can redirect the users to this page or embed it via iframe. Below is an example that renders an iframe with Paymentwall Widget.

<pre><code>widget = Paymentwall::Widget.new(
	'user40012',   # id of the end-user who's making the payment
	'p1_1',        # widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
	[              # product details for Flexible Widget Call. To let users select the product on Paymentwall's end, leave this array empty
		Paymentwall::Product.new(
			'product301',                            # id of the product in your system
			9.99,                                    # price
			'USD',                                   # currency code
			'Gold Membership',                       # product name
			Paymentwall::Product::TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION, # this is a time-based product
			1,                                       # duration is 1
			Paymentwall::Product::PERIOD_TYPE_MONTH, #               month
			true                                     # recurring
		)
  ],
	{'email' => 'user@hostname.com'}                 # additional parameters
)
puts widget.getHtmlCode()
</code></pre>

#### Pingback Processing

The Pingback is a webhook notifying about a payment being made. Pingbacks are sent via HTTP/HTTPS to your servers. To process pingbacks use the following code:
<pre><code>pingback = Paymentwall::Pingback.new(request_get_params, request_ip_address)
if pingback.validate()
  productId = pingback.getProduct().getId()
  if pingback.isDeliverable()
    # deliver the product
  elsif pingback.isCancelable()
    # withdraw the product
  end 
  puts 'OK' # Paymentwall expects response to be OK, otherwise the pingback will be resent
else
  puts pingback.getErrorSummary()
end</code></pre>

## Virtual Currency API

#### Initializing Paymentwall
<pre><code>require_relative '/path/to/paymentwall-ruby/lib/paymentwall.rb'
Paymentwall::Base::setApiType(Paymentwall::Base::API_VC)
Paymentwall::Base::setAppKey('YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY') # available in your Paymentwall merchant area
Paymentwall::Base::setSecretKey('YOUR_SECRET_KEY') # available in your Paymentwall merchant area
</code></pre>

#### Widget Call
<pre><code>widget = Paymentwall::Widget.new(
	'user40012', # id of the end-user who's making the payment
	'p1_1',      # widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
	[],          # array of products - leave blank for Virtual Currency API
	{'email' => 'user@hostname.com'} # additional parameters
)
puts widget.getHtmlCode()
</code></pre>

#### Pingback Processing
<pre><code>pingback = Paymentwall::Pingback.new(request_get_params, request_ip_address)
if pingback.validate()
  virtualCurrency = pingback.getVirtualCurrencyAmount()
  if pingback.isDeliverable()
    # deliver the virtual currency
  elsif pingback.isCancelable()
    # withdraw the virual currency
  end 
  puts 'OK' # Paymentwall expects response to be OK, otherwise the pingback will be resent
else
  puts pingback.getErrorSummary()
end</code></pre>

<pre><code>require_relative '/path/to/paymentwall-ruby/lib/paymentwall.rb'
Paymentwall::Base::setApiType(Paymentwall::Base::API_CART)
Paymentwall::Base::setAppKey('YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY') # available in your Paymentwall merchant area
Paymentwall::Base::setSecretKey('YOUR_SECRET_KEY') # available in your Paymentwall merchant area
</code></pre>
